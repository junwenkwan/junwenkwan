### Hi there 👋

My name is Jun Kwan. I am an aspiring software engineer working on deep learning projects.

Here are the research projects that I contributed to under Monash University:

* Object-Independent Human-to-Robot Handovers using Real Time Robotic Vision [[arXiv:2006.01797](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01797)]
* Gesture Recognition for Initiating Human-to-Robot Handovers [[arXiv:2007.09945](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09945)]
* Tabletop Object Rearrangement: Team ACRV's Entry to OCRTOC [[arXiv:2104.07188](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07188)]
* Research in Few-Shot Learning (Honours Year Project) [[link](https://github.com/junwenkwan/final-year-project)]
